 cache2.h
 The cache is not visible to the user. It should be flushed
 when any file is closed or changes are made to the filesystem.

 This cache implements a least-used-page replacement policy. This will
 distribute sectors evenly over the pages, so if less than the maximum
 pages are used at once, they should all eventually remain in the cache.
 This also has the benefit of throwing out old sectors, so as not to keep
 too many stale pages around.
